This means that the search algorithm may return the true nearest neighbor element to the query with some given probability (for example 95%), if not, most likely it will be the second closest and so on with sharply decreasing probability. \r\nThe algorithm requires a linear(n)*poly(d) space and the expected algorithms complexity is as follows:\r\n\r\n* insertion of one element into the structure ~log(n)* d^1.7 (  log(n)*poly(d)  );\r\n* approximate nearest neighbor search ~log(n)* d^1.7;\r\n* approximate k-nearest neighbor search ~k*log(n) * d^1.7;\r\n* deletion – not described yet, but supposedly complexity will be ~log(n) and poly(d).\r\n\r\nMSW has topology of the network constructed in such way, that starting from any node of the network, one can efficiently find any other node \r\nwithout the entire knowledge of network topology.\r\n\r\nAlso, the present code intended to demonstrate how a huge set of network nodes can efficiently communicate and find each other. \r\nThe search process based on the wide class of the distance functions (in contrast with DHT). \r\nThis makes it possible to apply MSW's algorithms for many real application which needs complex search and require a distributed architecture. \r\n\r\nThe list of papers related to the MSW presented below\r\n\r\n* Ponomarenko, A., Malkov, Y., Logvinov, A., & Krylov, V. published at ICTA 2011 proceedings.

(NN) The number of nearest neighbors used in construction algorithm to approximate Voronoi neighbors\r\n2. (K) number of k-closest elements for the k-nn search\r\n3. (initAttempts) - number of search attempts used during the construction of the structure\r\n4. (minAttempts) - minimum number of attempts which will be uses during the test search\r\n5. (maxAttempts) - maximum number of attempts\r\n6. (dataBaseSize) - the restriction of number elements in the data structure. To remove the restriction, set the value to 0.\r\n7. (querySetSize) - the restriction on the number of all possible queries. Set to 0 for unlimited number of queries.\r\n8. (testSeqSize) - the number elements in a randomly selected subset used to verify accuracy of the search. \r\n9. (dataPath) – the path to the directory containing the set frequency term vectors extracted from the set of documents.\r\n10. (queryPath) – the path to the set of frequency term vectors used as a set of all possible queries.\r\n\r\nNote that the example uses the Trec-3 data set as the part of [Metric Space Library](http://sisap.org/Metric_Space_Library.html)","google":"UA-66640072-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
